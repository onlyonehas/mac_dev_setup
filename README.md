# Personal Mac Dev Setup ðŸ’»

I had to install **everything** again from scratch.

### SSH:
To Generate an SSH key:
```
ssh-keygen
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
```

### GPG:

If you are on version 2.1.17 or greater, paste the text below to generate a GPG key pair.

    gpg --full-generate-key

Use the gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long command to list the long form of the GPG keys
    
    gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

Copy Id after the `sec   4096R/`

    gpg --armor --export **GPG key ID**
