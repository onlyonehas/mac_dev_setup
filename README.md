# Personal Mac Dev Setup ðŸ’»

---

## Description

On many occassions, I had to change laptops, which meant
I had to install ALL the things in the world, 
like **everything** again from scratch.

_So_... wrote this basic script to automate the process.

## Prerequisite

Install x-code which contains dev env for mac

# How to run the script

```
chmod 755 setup.sh
./setup.sh


```

## Still TO DO:

- [ ] Automate dot files
- [ ] Store secrets ie .aws, cers
- [ ] Hidden script to move/apply secrets
- [ ] Settings for vscode
- [ ] Alfred shortcuts 

Google Chrome:
Ensure to sign in and turn on sync in Chrome
to keep your browser customisation - bookmarks, extensions etc

Vs Code Sync:
You can turn on Settings Sync using the Turn On Settings Sync... entry in the Manage gear menu at the bottom of the Activity Bar.

If you are on version 2.1.17 or greater, paste the text below to generate a GPG key pair.
